# Signal Processing with Coral Edge TPU (Deprecated)

This Python-only implementation was the original starting point for the project. However, it was ultimately deprecated due to performance limitations and dependency on outdated Python versions required by the Coral libraries.

While it's not further developed, it may still serve as a useful reference for understanding how to run TensorFlow models on the Edge TPU.
