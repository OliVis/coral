# Project Demos 
### (Scheduled for Removal)

This directory contains demonstration scripts highlighting specific project features. Note that this subdirectory will probably be removed in the future.

### Running a Demo
To execute a demo script, navigate to the project root directory and use the following command:

```python
python -m demos.{file_name_without_.py}
```

Replace `{file_name_without_.py}` with the name of the desired demo script (excluding the .py extension).
